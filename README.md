# Recognizing Objects in Live Capture

Apply Vision algorithms to identify objects in real-time video.

## Overview

This Project's code in it's entirety was influence by apple's breakfast app sample but eddited to fit the objective:

The ML models pictures used in this project were collected from

Since we were free to choose any ML for object detection I decided to use Apple's Xcode CreateML's Object Detection.
The Data source used from roboflow were used to train with over 1000 iteration. This created very accurate ML models
